                        <p>My name is Kristen. 
                        I have a two year-old son named Desmond. He is quite the character. He absolutely loves counting and saying his alphabet and has become quite the little instigator. He is my little best friend.
                        <br><br>
                        I grew up wanting to be a web designer because my grandfather taught me from a young age that its something I would be good at.
                        My grandfather taught me about building websites when I was young, maybe ten years old, and I made my first webpages on Geocities.
                        This was more of a drag-and-drop kind of thing from what I remember but I thought it was fun. <br><br>
                        In high school I took web design courses where I learned HTML and CSS. This was 14 years ago so it has changed a lot since then!
                        I wanted to study web design after high school but there weren't any programs that I knew of. Also, my parents wanted me to get a bachelor's degree.
                        SO...I pursued another interest of mine which was to become a doctor. That's why I have a bachelor's degree in Biology from Gordon College. <br><br> 
                        I've had a lot of personal life changes that I didn't expect after college including having a son.
                        I have stayed at home with Desmond for the past few years and started an online clothing re-selling business. 
                        I currently work from home selling pre-owned clothing on Poshmark and eBay.
